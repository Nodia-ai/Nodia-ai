Nodia: Power the Future, Decentralize the Grid.
üöÄ Welcome to Nodia
Nodia is a groundbreaking decentralized AI compute network built on Solana. We empower individuals and organizations to deploy intelligent compute nodes ‚Äì Nodia Devices ‚Äì in their homes or offices. These devices contribute processing power for diverse AI tasks, machine learning, and edge computing, earning participants NODIA tokens as passive income. We're building a self-healing, distributed network to democratize AI compute and break the monopoly of centralized cloud providers.

‚ú® Key Features
Decentralized AI Compute: Global mesh network for cost-effective and censorship-resistant AI processing.

Passive Income: Earn NODIA tokens for every verified compute task your device completes.

Edge Computing: Real-time AI inference directly at the source, crucial for low-latency applications.

Privacy & Security: End-to-end AES-256 encryption and zk-SNARK proofs ensure data integrity without exposure.

Self-Healing Network: Automatic task re-routing ensures near 100% uptime even if nodes go offline.

Scalable by Design: Seamlessly add new Nodia Devices to expand network capacity without downtime.

Eco-Friendly: Low-power Nodia Devices reduce the carbon footprint of AI compute.

‚öôÔ∏è How Nodia Works
Connect Your Nodia Device: Plug in your Nodia Core, Edge, or Atlas device to power and internet.

Join the Nodia Mesh: Register on the Nodia Dashboard, sync your Solana wallet, and your device automatically integrates into the global compute grid.

Process AI Workloads: Your node is assigned tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, or model training.

Earn NODIA Tokens: For every successfully completed and verified task, you earn NODIA tokens, automatically credited to your wallet.

üíª Nodia Devices
Choose the right device for your needs:

Nodia Core: Entry-level, efficient for lightweight AI and IoT tasks.

Nodia Edge: Standard compute device for machine learning inference and real-time analytics.

Nodia Atlas: Enterprise-grade powerhouse for high-performance AI compute and large-scale edge processing.

üìä Tokenomics
The NODIA Token is the native cryptocurrency of the Nodia network, built as an SPL token on Solana.

Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 NODIA

Utility: Used for task submissions, staking for enhanced earnings, and microtransactions within the Nodia Dashboard.

Staking: Stake NODIA to increase task priority, reduce network fees, and gain governance voting rights.
