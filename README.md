## Welcome to Nodia

Nodia is a groundbreaking decentralized AI compute network built on Solana. We empower individuals and organizations to deploy intelligent compute nodes â€“ Nodia Devices â€“ in their homes or offices. 
These devices contribute processing power for diverse AI tasks, machine learning, and edge computing, earning participants NODIA tokens as passive income. 
We're building a self-healing, distributed network to democratize AI compute and break the monopoly of centralized cloud providers.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized AI Compute:** Global mesh network for cost-effective and censorship-resistant AI processing.
- **Passive Income:** Earn NODIA tokens for every verified compute task your device completes.
- **Edge Computing:** Real-time AI inference directly at the source, crucial for low-latency applications.
- **Privacy & Security:** End-to-end AES-256 encryption and zk-SNARK proofs ensure data integrity without exposure.
- **Self-Healing Network:** Automatic task re-routing ensures near 100% uptime even if nodes go offline.
- **Scalable by Design:** Seamlessly add new Nodia Devices to expand network capacity without downtime.
- **Eco-Friendly:** Low-power Nodia Devices reduce the carbon footprint of AI compute.
